I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

eval = FALSE: code will be displayed but not executed; results are not included.
echo = FALSE: code will be executed but not displayed; results are included.
include = FALSE: code wonâ€™t be executed or displayed.
message = FALSE and warning = FALSE: prevents messages and warnings from being displayed.
results = hide and fig.show = hide: prevents results and figures from being shown, respectively.
collapse = TRUE: output will be collapsed into a single block at shown at the end of the chunk.
error: errors in code will stop rendering when FALSE; errors in code will be printed in the doc when TRUE. The default is FALSE and you should almost never change it.

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r, message = FALSE}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
`round(mean(samp), 2)`

# Section 3

This is going to make a plot! First I generate a dataframe, then use `ggplot` to make a scatterplot and nameming a code chunk!
```{r chunk_scatterplot}
plot_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 1000),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(n = 1000)
  )

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```


# Section 4

This creates a dataframe comprised of: a numeric variable containing a random sample of size 500 from a normal variable with mean 1; a logical vector indicating whether each sampled value is greater than zero; and a numeric vector containing the absolute value of each element. Then, produce a histogram of the absolute value variable just created. Add an inline summary giving the median value rounded to two decimal places. What happens if you set eval = FALSE to the code chunk? What about echo = FALSE?

```{r}
la_df = 
  tibble(
    norm = rnorm(n = 500), mean = 1,
    logical = norm > 0,
    abs_norm = abs(norm)
  )

ggplot(la_df, aes(abs_norm)) + geom_histogram()

```

## Section 4a
eval = FALSE: code will be displayed but not executed; results are not included.
echo = FALSE: code will be executed but not displayed; results are included.
